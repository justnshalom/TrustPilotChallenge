# A fast solution to the TrustPilot Code Challenge - Backend Developer

The problem:

You've made an important decision. Now, let's get to the matter.

We have a message for you. But we hid it. 
Unless you know the secret phrase, it will remain hidden.

Can you write the algorithm to find it?

Here is a couple of important hints to help you out:
- An anagram of the phrase is: "poultry outwits ants"
- There are three levels of difficulty to try your skills with
- The MD5 hash of the easiest secret phrase is "e4820b45d2277f3844eac66c903e84be"
- The MD5 hash of the more difficult secret phrase is "23170acc097c24edb98fc5488ab033fe"
- The MD5 hash of the hard secret phrase is "665e5bcb0c20062fe8abaaf4628bb154"
Here is a list of english words, it should help you out.



The solution contains 3 projects:

1. Analysis - a small program to benchmark the performance of the algorithm
2. TrustPilot - the actual algorithm implementation
3. UnitTests - unit tests to cover most of the code

To run the algorithm open TrustPilot.sln, make sure TrustPilot is the startup project, press Start, and then follow the instructions on the screen.
For best performance use the Release version.
For a detailed description of the algorithm see ALGORITHM.MD
