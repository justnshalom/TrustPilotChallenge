# A fast solution to the TrustPilot Code Challenge - Backend Developer

The solution contains 3 projects:

1. Analysis - a small program to benchmark the performance of the algorithm
2. TrustPilot - the actual algorithm implementation
3. UnitTests - unit tests to cover most of the code

To run the algorithm make sure TrustPilot is the startup project and press Start, then follow the instructions on the screen.
For best performance use the Release version.
For a detailed description of the algorithm see ALGORITHM.MD
